# Deep Research Repository

The results collected here are obtained from running the [following](https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research) research assistant.  **Note:** The output generated by these scripts is for experimental and learning purposes only. Hallucinations have yet to be ruled out. Always verify the source itself.

*Reports without sources were due to the Firecrawl API hitting the daily request limits. Upgrade to a free account if you plan on running multiple reports per day. In the future. having the research assistant revisit the reports to add sources will be critical to address the API limit issue.*
