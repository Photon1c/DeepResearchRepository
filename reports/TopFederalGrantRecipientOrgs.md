## Methodology

### Data Collection

Our analysis consolidated data from multiple authoritative sources, including:

- **USASpending.gov:** The platform providing detailed snapshots of Federal spending across agencies.
- **Agency Financial Reports:** Direct insight from Federal agencies such as NIH, NSF, DoD, and others.
- **Peer-Reviewed Research and Prior Analysis:** Previous comprehensive studies which have outlined trends in Federal grant distributions.

### Data Processing

Data was aggregated using standardized metrics to ensure comparability across different funding agencies:

1. **Normalization:** Each analysis unit (organization) was normalized to account for multi-agency grants and overlapping funding initiatives.
2. **Filtering:** Only grants awarded in FY 2024 and exceeding a minimum threshold were taken into account, eliminating smaller or pilot grants that might distort overall dollar value percentages.
3. **Categorization:** Organizations were categorized based on their primary nature (e.g., universities, non-profits, private companies).

### Analytical Framework

We applied multiple quantitative methods:

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing monetary distributions, including mean, median, and total awards per organization.
- **Ranking Algorithms:** Identifying the top 25 recipients by total award value.
- **Sector Analysis:** Determining trends and patterns among different types of organizations, supplementing the raw rankings with qualitative insights.

Various visualization techniques assisted in identifying funding clusters and overlaps between different categories. These included scatter plots showing grant size distribution, bar graphs for organization count differences, and heatmaps to visualize inter-agency overlaps.

## Data Sources and Research Learnings

Although federal grant data analysis can be complex due to variations in how agencies report spending, our research built upon previously validated methodologies. Some of the learnings from previous studies include:

- **Inter-agency Trends:** Similar organizations consistently appear at the top of ranking lists due to longstanding institutional expertise and established administrative capacity.
- **Diverse Recipient Types:** While universities dominate the list, there is a notable presence of non-profit organizations especially those specializing in targeted research demos such as climate change, cybersecurity, and advanced health technologies.
- **Innovative Funding Pathways:** Emerging mechanisms—such as public-private partnerships and challenge grants—are reshaping the traditional distribution of Federal funds.
- **Implications for Policy:** Our findings are instrumental for understanding how next-generation research trends may evolve, particularly with increased focus on innovation clusters and in-network collaborations.

These learnings guided our detailed analysis in constructing a robust, multi-dimensional framework for evaluating the top recipients by dollar amount.
